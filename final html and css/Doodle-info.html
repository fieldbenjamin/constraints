	<p>Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling</p>
	</div>
	<div id="text">
	<p>Written by British author J. K. Rowling, the Harry Potter series consists of 7 novels. They focus on the life of an 11-year old Harry Potter, who is suddenly thrust into the wizarding world when he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Each novel represents a different school year, beginning with his first, and ending in his final seventh year. The main villain of the story is Voldemort, and the novels follow his mission to rise to power, kill Harry, and one day rule over the wizarding world, subjugating all non-wizards. </p>
	<p>The series has found immense success across the world, selling more than 500 million copies worldwide, and translated into more than 80 languages. Harry Potter is the best-selling book series of all time.</p>
	<p>The series has also been adapted into a 8-installment movie series, which also found incredible success. The entire series has totaled a box office of $7.7 billion, with the final movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, grossing $1.3 billion, making it one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The entire franchise has been valued at estimated $25 billion.</p>
	<p>This success has led to the expansion of J.K. Rowling’s wizarding world into far more than the novels. The “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie has evolved into a five-part film franchise, with the released movies performing extremely well in the box office. Universal Studios has built a number of Harry Potter themed attractions at their Wizarding World of Harry Potter parks in Orlando, Japan, Hollywood, and Beijing.</p>
